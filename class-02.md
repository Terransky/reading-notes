* HTML Chapter 2: Text
  * Using tags, known as markup, we can style and add extra semantic information to text. They can be structural or semantic.
  * Examples of tag elements include headings, paragraphs, line breaks, and horizontal rules.
  * Semantic markup can add mark text as needing emphasis or quotes, which can be helpful for things like screen readers.

* CSS Chapter 8: Introducing CSS
  * The key to understanding how CSS works it to imagine there is a box around every element with margin, border, and padding.
  * CSS rules contain a selector and declarations. The declarations are made up of a property and value.
  * There are many types of selectors to specify which elements to target in html in a variety of patterns.
  * Precedence is decided by specificity or the !important value, otherwise the last overwrites the previous.
  * Child elements will inherit properties from parent elements.

* JS Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions
  * A statement is an individual instruction and must end in a semicolon.
  * Variables store data that can be recalled later and used elsewhere.
  * Variables must be declared with a name and assigned a value with the equals sign.
  * Some of the data types are numberic, string, and boolean.
  * Multiple variables can be declared on the same line so long as they're separated by commas.
  * Variable names CANNOT start with a number. They must begin with a letter, $, or _ and can only use those characters.
  * Variables names may not use hyphens or periods or keywords or reserved words.
  * An array is a variable that stores more than one value and is declared with square brackets.
  * Each value in an array is stored at an index in order starting from 0.
  * Arithmetic operators allow for basic calculations and incrementing, decrementing, and modulus to get the remainder.

* JS Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops
  * For a decision in code to be made, an expression must be evaluated and a conditional statement determines which instructions are deployed.
  * Comparison operators include ===, !==, and greater or less than.
  * If the expression is true, the code will run. If not, it passes over the whole block nested in the conditional.
  * Logical operators allow for more robust conditions, such as whether both or all expressions must be true or only 1.
  * If and If Else statements check whether a condition is true and runs that block of code and only that block when fulfilled.
