* HTML Chapter 1: Structure
  * uses elements, denoted by opening and closing tags enclosed by angle brackets, to order the structure of a web page
  * opening tags may have attributes, which require a name and value, to inform more about the content of the element

* HTML Chapter 8: Extra Markup
  * elements can be given unique id or class attributes to refer to
  * block level elements start on a new line and take up the entire available width of the page
  * inline level elements start next to the prior element
  * div tags are generic block level containers and span tags are generic inline element containers
  * iframe tags act as a portal for embedding other website, like google maps
  * meta tags contain information that aren't displayed but may be relevent to things like search engines or about the author
  * Some characters, like quotes and angle brackets, are reserved by HTML and require escape characters to display

* HTML Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
  * Apparently with the advent of HTML5 div tags were largely replaced with tags that intuitively described their purpose
  * Extra CSS and/or JavaScript is needed to have HTML5 interact with older browsers, letting it know which new tags are block or inline
  * Some of the new tag functionality include header and footer, which always display at the top and bottom of a page respectively

* HTML Chapter 18: Process & Design
  * Where to begin... Decide who your target audience is and plan the design of the website around that
  * Draw or make a wireframe with a program to plan the content of the webpage before writing the code
  * Use visual hierarchy to attract the consumer's attention to key points
  * Use grouping and similarity of images to form consistent themes
  * Size, color, and style can be used to easily distinguish between pieces of information

* JS Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming
  * At its core, a script is just a series of instructions a computer can follow step by step
  * By that logic, break down the goal into a series of tasks that need to be complete to achieve the goal, possibly with a flowchart
  * In JavaScript, practically everything is an object, an instance with properties that "describe" it and can be referenced or manipulated
  * HTML runs the script when it comes to it in the code, which is why we often put the script at the bottom to run last
  * JavaScript doesn't modify the HTML itself but rather the Document Object Model (DOM) they work to create together
